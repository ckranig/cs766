This project assumes that Images should be returned from showCorrespondence, backwardWarpImg, blendImagePair, and stitchImg as specified in the homework description.

For inputs expecting nx2 Point arrays it is assumed that they are in the fashion [[x0,y0],[x1,y1]...]

In stitchImg swap lines 270 and 271 if you want a more cropped output
